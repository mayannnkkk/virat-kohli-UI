        Virat Kohli, one of the greatest modern-day cricketers, has had an
        illustrious career in T20 cricket. Renowned for his consistency,
        adaptability, and remarkable chasing ability, Kohli has been a
        cornerstone of India's T20 International (T20I) team since his debut in
        2010. As of now, he is among the highest run-scorers in T20I history,
        with multiple records to his name, including being the fastest to
        significant milestones like 2,000 and 3,000 T20I runs. Kohli’s batting
        average and strike rate stand out, especially in high-pressure
        situations, where he has often guided India to memorable wins. He has
        also been a star performer in the Indian Premier League (IPL),
        captaining the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and amassing over 7,000
        runs, including numerous centuries and fifties. Kohli’s aggressive yet
        calculated approach, combined with his impeccable fitness and
        commitment, makes him one of the most iconic figures in T20 cricket
        history.
